#
# The functions below decide which verdicts refuse a merge. A verdict word that
# no caller recognises falls into a default arm, and one of those default arms
# — after()'s — prints WAIT. WAIT is not a refusal: it tells the operator to
# sit and wait for a run that has already finished. So a new word added to
# describe a *failure* can quietly start permitting one, and it would do it
# while every visible symptom looked like better diagnostics.
#
# These cases therefore assert the REFUSAL and not the wording. Asserting that
# "UNTESTED" appears somewhere would pass just as happily in the broken state.
