# Reading a local test run before a gate

A gate is only as good as the run behind it. These are the ways a local run has lied to this lane,
written down so the next reader does not rediscover them one merge at a time.

## The rule: a test that depends on a path's class must assert that class

`arbos-core/src/approval.rs` sorts every path into a **class** — `Scratch`, `Workspace`,
`Anywhere` — and much of the approval behaviour is a function of that class and nothing else.
A test that needs a path to be one class and never says so is not testing what it reads as
testing. It is testing the class its checkout happens to produce.

The rule is about the class, not about any one directory. Keying it on `/tmp` would cover one
instance and leave the identical hole one class over, where a test meaning `Anywhere` quietly
gets `Workspace`.

### The worked example, because this one actually bit us

On 2026-11-06 a full `-p arbos-agentd` run from a worktree at `/tmp/wt2888` reported
`approval::job_approval_tests::a_job_deleting_a_file_it_created_itself_raises_no_card` as failed:
`left: "allowed"`, `right: "pending"`. The pull request under the gate had not touched
`approval.rs`.

The test uses `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/Cargo.toml")` as its stand-in for "a file the
job found rather than made", and `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` is baked in at compile time from wherever
the checkout sits. `SCRATCH_ROOTS` is `["/tmp", "/work/tmp"]` (`approval.rs:311`), and a delete
raises no card when every target is in scratch. From a `/tmp` checkout the stand-in **is** scratch,
so "allowed" was the correct answer to a question the test did not mean to ask. Re-run from
`/home/ubuntu/wt2888`, the same commit passed 526/0/2.

### Which direction bites

| Polarity | What happens from the wrong checkout | How you find out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asserts `"pending"` | Fails | Immediately, loudly |
| Asserts `"allowed"` | **Passes, asserting nothing** | Never |

The loud one is the lucky one. The quiet one is the reason this is a rule and not a note: a case
reading "a delete outside scratch raises a card" passes from a `/tmp` checkout without raising
anything, and no suite anywhere goes red to say so.

Audited on 2026-11-06: `-p arbos-agentd` has exactly one env-derived absolute path in its approval
tests, `approval.rs:1901`, and it asserts `"pending"` — the loud polarity. So the quiet direction
is not currently present in those counts.

## The safety below it is incidental, and a reasonable refactor removes it

Relative paths in those tests are location-independent today, but not by design:

- `classify_path` returns `Anywhere` for anything not starting with `/`
  (`arbos-core/src/approval.rs:435`).
- `delete_targets_with` seeds its working directory from a constant, not from the process:
  `let mut cwd = WORKSPACE_ROOT.to_owned();` (`:717`). So `rm -rf dist` resolves to `/work/dist`
  wherever the binary runs.

A hardcoded cwd is plainly wrong in a walker that reads `cd`, so giving it a real one is the
natural fix for some unrelated bug. The day that lands, **every relative-path approval test becomes
location-dependent in a single commit**, the quiet direction goes live across the whole file at
once, and nothing fails to announce it.

That is why this is written down rather than left to the suite. A safety a sensible refactor
silently removes is worth more as a warning than as a passing test.

## Operationally, for this lane

Run agentd suites from a checkout outside `/tmp`. That is a consequence of the rule, not the rule.
Record the worktree path beside any local test count reported as gate evidence, so a number can be
re-read later against the class it was measured in.
