#
# Why this file exists. Until 2026-10-31 both tools judged a head by rejecting known-bad conclusions
# among whatever the PR's check rollup happened to report. "skipped" and "neutral" are on no
# deny-list, and a gate that never ran reports nothing at all, so all three read as a pass. Measured
# on 3e5549e077d00d2f3a91226ca2f4063d9d0d241b: the deny-list's output was identical to what it would
# print for a head whose Swift gate had never existed. A deny-list cannot tell "nothing is wrong"
# from "nothing is there".
#
# So the gates below are named instead, and each must be PRESENT and successful on the pinned head.
# Silence is a refusal. Every uncertainty — an unparseable filter, a short read, an unreadable API —
# is BLOCKED, never "not required".
#
# This list IS the repository's required-check policy. main has no branch protection and no ruleset
# (branches/main reports "protected": false; rulesets and rules/branches/main are both empty), and
# the protection endpoint needs a token with Administration:Read, which the merge lane's token is
# not. Nothing on GitHub's side requires any check, so nothing but this file does. Keep it in step
# with .github/workflows/.

# rd <gh api args>: the read, or "BLOCKED:<error>" with a non-zero status. A failed read never
# becomes a verdict.

# GATES: one line per required check — <workflow file>|<human name>. A gate applies to a head only
# when that head's diff touches the workflow's own path filter, so a Mac-only change is not asked
# for an iPhone verdict.
#
# ci.yml is deliberately absent. Its requiredness turns on `paths-ignore`, which merge-window.sh's
# verdict() already reads for a different purpose, and asserting it here without that logic would
# refuse legitimate iOS-only merges. Adding it is a separate change with its own proof.
