//! Markdown → [`Doc`].
//!
//! CommonMark nests; a [`Doc`] does not. Indent counts **list nesting only**:
//!
//! - a list item's first paragraph becomes its marker block (bullet, ordered,
//!   task) at one level shallower than the open list count, and anything else
//!   in that item becomes a child at the list count itself;
//! - a blockquote's paragraphs each become a [`BlockKind::Quote`]. Being inside
//!   a quote decides a block's *kind*, never its depth — an indent a blockquote
//!   contributed could not be reproduced in the output, and the document would
//!   move every time it was read;
//! - everything else keeps its kind at the open list count.
//!
//! Mixed containers therefore flatten: `> - a` yields a bullet and loses the
//! quote. That is the cost of the flat model, and the fixed-point test in
//! [`crate::serialize`] is what keeps it from mattering — whatever the first
//! parse decides is stable from then on.
//!
//! The parse also normalizes what markdown itself would not preserve: leading
//! and trailing whitespace per line, blank lines at a block's edges, headings
//! and table cells flattened to one line, and ordered runs renumbered
//! consecutively. Each of those is a place where writing the document back out
//! and reading it again would otherwise land somewhere new.
