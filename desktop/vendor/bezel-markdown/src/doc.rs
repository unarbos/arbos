//! The document model.
//!
//! A [`Doc`] is a **flat** list of [`Block`]s with an indent level, not a
//! nested tree. That is Notion's model rather than CommonMark's, and it is the
//! decision the rest of this crate hangs off: editing a flat list means Enter
//! splits, Backspace merges, and Tab indents — all list operations. On a
//! nested tree "the previous block" is a traversal and every edit is a
//! restructure.
//!
//! The trade is that arbitrarily nested CommonMark does not survive a round
//! trip: a list inside a quote inside a list flattens. Notion has the same
//! limitation. What is guaranteed is [`crate::serialize`]'s fixed point —
//! parse, serialize, parse again, and the document is unchanged — so an
//! edit/save cycle never drifts.
