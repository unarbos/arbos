//! Text you can select with the pointer and copy out of.
//!
//! The two hard halves are already here: [`render_with`] paints a [`Selection`]
//! it is handed, and fills a [`BlockLayouts`] whose [`BlockLayouts::hit`] turns
//! a point back into a [`Cursor`]. What was missing is the *gesture* — press,
//! drag, release — which belonged to whoever owns the selection, and until now
//! only an editor ever did.
//!
//! This is that gesture and nothing else. Which item holds the selection, and
//! what copying means, stay the caller's.
