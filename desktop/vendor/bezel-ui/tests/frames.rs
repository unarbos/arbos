//! What the library costs a window that is sitting still, against what the
//! obvious way of writing the same thing costs it.
//!
//! Two numbers say it. `simulate_next_frame` returns how many per-frame
//! callbacks were waiting — anything above zero is an element asking to be
//! redrawn at the display's rate, for as long as it stays mounted, and it asks
//! on behalf of the whole window. The render count is what that costs, since a
//! redraw rebuilds the element tree, re-runs layout and re-shapes text.
//!
//! [`Drive`] is the same animation written three ways, which is what makes the
//! comparison fair: gpui's default, gpui's own throttle, and bezel's shared
//! clock.
//!
//! The test clock is why these are assertions rather than a stopwatch:
//! `advance_clock` moves the executor's timers without moving the wall clock,
//! so a second of spinner passes in microseconds. It also means
//! `PulseClock`'s leases — held against `Instant::now()` — never expire here,
//! which is why parking is watched on the gallery's overlay instead.
