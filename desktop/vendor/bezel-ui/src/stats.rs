//! [`Stats`] — the meter: how many frames this window is drawing, and what the
//! process, the GPU and memory cost, while you watch it.
//!
//! A window at rest reads `0`. The count comes from this view's own renders,
//! which is the same number: gpui re-renders every uncached view once per
//! window draw. The one render it does not count is the one its own tick
//! provoked, and [`Painter::woken`] is what says which that was — the clock
//! knows, so nothing here has to infer it from a stopwatch. Those two draws a
//! second are the meter's own cost, and the CPU figure includes them.
//!
//! Placement is the caller's, as it is for [`crate::control_bar`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let meter = cx.new(Stats::new);
//! div().relative().size_full()
//!     .child(page)
//!     .child(div().absolute().top(px(16.0)).right(px(16.0)).child(meter.clone()))
//! ```
//!
//! [`crate::floating::panel`] is what makes one draggable.
