//! [`TextField`] — a single-line text field with IME, selection and clipboard.
//!
//! Unlike the rest of this crate, a text field cannot be a plain function
//! returning a `Div`: editing needs state (content, selection, IME marked
//! range), a focus handle, and gpui's [`EntityInputHandler`]. So it is an
//! entity the caller holds — SwiftUI's `TextField` bound to `@State`, not a
//! stateless view.
//!
//! Ported from gpui's `examples/input.rs` (Apache-2.0), restyled onto
//! [`Theme`] tokens, with the key bindings **scoped to the field's key
//! context** rather than installed globally: a component library must not make
//! `cmd-a` mean "select all text" for the whole application.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ui::input::init(cx);                      // once, at startup
//! let field = cx.new(|cx| TextField::new(cx).with_placeholder("Search…"));
//! // …then render it: .child(field.clone())
//! ```
