//! Keyboard focus traversal — `tab` and `shift-tab` between controls.
//!
//! gpui has all the machinery and none of it is on by default: a focus handle
//! carries a `tab_index` and a `tab_stop` flag, `.track_focus` registers the
//! handle for the frame, and [`Window::focus_next`] walks the order — but
//! `tab_stop` starts `false` and gpui binds no keys. This module turns it on.
//!
//! # Order is paint order
//!
//! gpui sorts tab stops by their `tab_index` path and then by insertion, so
//! leaving every index at 0 yields the order the controls are painted in.
//! Nothing has to be numbered by hand, and inserting a control in the middle of
//! a form does not renumber the rest — which is the failure mode that makes
//! HTML `tabindex` a liability.
//!
//! # Where the handle lives
//!
//! Most of this crate is `fn(&Theme, ..) -> Div`: stateless, with the app
//! owning whether a checkbox is checked. Focus is more of that state, so the
//! app owns the handle too and [`focusable`] wires it up. Giving every widget a
//! handle of its own would mean giving every widget an identity and a lifetime,
//! which is the entity machinery [`crate::input::TextField`] needs and a
//! checkbox does not.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ui::focus::init(cx);                    // once, at startup
//!
//! // ..and on the root view, so `tab` works wherever focus currently is:
//! focus::traversal(div().track_focus(&self.focus_handle))
//!     .child(focus::focusable(&theme, &self.ok_focus, popover::button(&theme, "OK", "ok")))
//! ```
