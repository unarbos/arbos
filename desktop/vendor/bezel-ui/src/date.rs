//! [`Calendar`] — a date picker: the closed face of a select over an anchored
//! month grid.
//!
//! An entity for the same reason [`crate::combobox::Combobox`] is one. It owns
//! navigation state the app has no opinion about — which month is on screen,
//! where the keyboard cursor sits — and reports the one thing the app does care
//! about, through [`CalendarEvent`]. A select needs no such component, because a
//! select has no state but the caller's; a calendar does.
//!
//! [`Date`] is bezel's own, deliberately. chrono is already in the graph under
//! gpui, so taking it would cost nothing to compile — and would make it a
//! *public* dependency, so a consumer declaring its own `chrono` would end up
//! with two incompatible ones. That is the split-graph failure `bezel::gpui`
//! exists to prevent, and it buys nothing here: a picker needs no timezones, no
//! parsing and no formatting. It needs the civil calendar, which is sixty lines
//! and pure — everything above the horizontal rule below is testable without a
//! window, and is tested.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ui::date::init(cx);   // once, at startup
//! let picker = cx.new(|cx| Calendar::new(today, cx));
//! cx.subscribe(&picker, |_, _, event, _| match event {
//!     CalendarEvent::Selected(date) => { /* the chosen day */ }
//! })
//! .detach();
//! ```
