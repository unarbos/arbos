//! [`control_bar`] — the floating control bar: a glass surface holding a
//! leading cluster, an optional centre, and a trailing cluster. Apple Music's
//! transport, a desktop agent app's composer, a floating toolbar.
//!
//! [`Shape`] is the only thing that differs between those; everything below is
//! shape-blind, which is why the module is named for the job rather than for
//! the stadium it started as.
//!
//! Two things it exists to get right.
//!
//! **The blur corners follow the border.** [`Shape`] rounds the bar, and
//! [`crate::surface::Surfaced::surface`] cuts the surface to the rounding it
//! finds — a blur squarer than its border frosts the corners outside it.
//!
//! **The centre is centred on the bar, not on what the clusters leave.** The
//! two rails are equal-flex and the centre is not: clusters of five controls
//! and three then keep the middle on axis. Flexing the centre between them
//! instead is the classic toolbar bug — it lands wherever the wider cluster
//! pushes it.
//!
//! That second rule is why the bar takes the **width it is given** rather than
//! hugging its controls. Equal rails need free space to be equal *about*; a
//! shrink-to-fit bar has none, and its middle then lands wherever the clusters
//! happen to put it. So width is the caller's, and a `max_w` is how a wide
//! window gets a floating bar instead of a docked one.
//!
//! Placement is the caller's too, and it is four lines. This bar floats *over*
//! content and must never reflow it — the same overlay-never-a-gutter rule
//! [`crate::scroll`] follows. A bar that *does* reflow its content is a dock,
//! not this: no blur, no float, and nothing here to reuse.
//!
//! ```ignore
