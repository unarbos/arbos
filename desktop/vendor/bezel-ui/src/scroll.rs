//! What gpui's own scroll handles leave to the app: a bar to show the position,
//! and a rule for which pane a wheel belongs to.
//!
//! gpui scrolls a `div` perfectly well and draws nothing while it does, so a
//! bezel app has no way to show how far down it is. This is that bar: the
//! caller keeps its own `overflow_y_scroll` container, because a wrapper that
//! swallowed the content would have to re-implement layout for it. Nesting two
//! of those containers is [`claim_wheel`]'s business.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! div().relative()                                  // the bar is absolute in here
//!     .child(
//!         div()
//!             .id("pane")
//!             .size_full()
//!             .overflow_y_scroll()
//!             .track_scroll(&self.scroll)           // gpui's handle, the app's field
//!             .child(content),
//!     )
//!     .child(scroll::scrollbar("pane-bar", &self.scroll, &self.scroll_bar))
//! ```
//!
//! The bar must span the container it reports on — its track *is* the viewport,
//! in the coordinates [`thumb`] answers in.
//!
//! The geometry is transcribed from zed's own scrollbar (`thumb_ranges` in
//! `crates/ui/src/components/scrollbar.rs`), which is 1722 lines of settings
//! system around the fifteen that matter. Two of gpui's conventions are easy to
//! get backwards and both are load-bearing here: `max_offset` is the *overflow*
//! (content minus viewport, not content), and `offset` is **negative** as you
//! scroll down.
//!
//! [`transient`] is the same bar, shown only while its content moves.
