//! Pagination — for data that arrives in pages, not for lists that are long.
//!
//! Worth saying plainly, because the distinction is the whole reason this
//! module is small and late: a long list is answered by [`crate::scroll`] and
//! [`crate::list`], which will show ten thousand rows and build nine of them. A
//! paginator earns its place only when the *data* is paged and the client
//! cannot hold the whole set — an API that answers "page 4 of 87", a report with
//! a fixed page size, a backend that will not stream. There the page number is
//! not a scrolling affordance, it is the query.
//!
//! What it contributes is one function. [`window`] turns `(current, total)` into
//! the row you see, and it is the part that is fiddly rather than obvious:
//!
//! ```text
//! current = 6, total = 20   →   1 … 4 5 [6] 7 8 … 20
//! current = 2, total = 20   →   1 [2] 3 4 5 … 20
//! current = 3, total = 5    →   1 2 [3] 4 5
//! ```
//!
//! Which page you are on, how many there are, and how to fetch one are all the
//! caller's — as with [`crate::table`]'s sort, this module reports and paints.
