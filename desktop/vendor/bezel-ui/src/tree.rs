//! Tree view — nested rows with disclosure, indent guides and arrow keys.
//!
//! bezel cannot walk your tree. It has no idea what a node is, and a trait or a
//! callback to find out would be a data model this library does not want to
//! own — so the app flattens its own tree into the rows that are visible right
//! now, which it has to do anyway to render them.
//!
//! That is not a compromise, because **a depth-annotated flat list is a
//! complete navigation model**. Everything a tree does falls out of [`Row`]
//! with no parent pointers and no tree walk: down and up are neighbouring
//! indices, a first child is simply the next row, and a parent is the nearest
//! row above with a smaller depth. [`step`] is that, and nothing else.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ui::tree::init(cx);   // once, at startup
//!
//! // Each frame: flatten what is open, paint it, and let `step` answer the keys.
//! let rows = self.flatten();                       // Vec<(Row, label)>
//! tree().children(rows.iter().enumerate().map(|(index, (row, label))| {
//!     tree_row(&theme, row, self.selected == Some(index), self.cursor == index)
//!         .id(("row", index))
//!         .child(label.clone())
//! }))
//! ```
//!
//! Expansion stays with the app because it *is* app data — a file tree's open
//! folders often outlive the window — so [`step`] reports an intent, and the app
//! applies it to the set it owns.
