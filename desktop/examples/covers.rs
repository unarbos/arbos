//! ```
//!
//! The content is not this program's business — articles are written by hand,
//! and this only gives them their pictures. Each one is cut through the app's
//! own [`cover::seed`] and [`cover::svg`], from the article's own path, so a
//! fixture ends up with exactly the picture cydonia would have landed on for
//! that document.
//!
//! Articles that already have a cover are left alone, so this can be run again
//! after more have been written.
