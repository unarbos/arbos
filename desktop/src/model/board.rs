//! A project's boards: columns of task cards, and the files that outlive them.
//!
//! Machine-written like [`crate::model::state`], and kept in the project's own
//! `.arbos/desktop/` — a board is the project's work, so it travels with the
//! directory rather than living under a path in the config dir that a rename
//! would orphan.
//!
//! One file per board, named for the millisecond it was made. An id rather
//! than the name: the name is a property, and a file named after it would be a
//! second copy of it that a refused rename could leave disagreeing.
//!
//! Cards nest inside their column, so a `Vec` position *is* the order and a
//! move is a remove and an insert. A flat list with an ordinal only earns its
//! keep where several views group the same cards differently.
