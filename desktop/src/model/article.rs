//! A project's articles: title, properties and content, under `.arbos/desktop/`.
//!
//! An article is a directory — `articles/untitled/` holding `content.md`, the
//! `properties.toml` beside it, and the cover. The markdown is content and
//! nothing else: an article is written to be read by the agent running in that
//! directory, and a path is how it gets handed over.
//!
//! The directory is named for when it was made, and nothing reads that name.
//! An id rather than a title: the title is a property, and a directory named
//! after it would be a second copy of it that a refused rename could leave
//! disagreeing — and a path already handed to an agent is not one we can
//! rewrite the way a vault rewrites its own links.
