//! The project's database: SQL tables the agent creates and queries, in a file
//! of its own under the project's `.arbos/desktop/`.
//!
//! SQLite's catalog is the registry — columns are read back out of `PRAGMA
//! table_info`, so there is no second list of them to fall out of step with the
//! first, which is the drift that rots this kind of feature. A table's `key` is
//! the SQL identifier and never moves; its `name` is free text, so renaming one
//! cannot break a query the agent already wrote. Reads go to a handle opened
//! read-only: what stops a `SELECT` writing is the connection itself, never
//! anything believed about the text.
