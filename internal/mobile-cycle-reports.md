# iPhone loop — cycle reports

A copy of each cycle's closing report, in the order sent, so a report missed in the conversation can be read here. The ledger is `mobile-findings.md`; the rotation record is `mobile-coverage.md`.

## Cycle 37 report (00:31 and 00:46 UTC, 09-17)

Sent in two parts. `main` `55dd38bd` on the simulator against the ArbosLife hub with the phone token.

- Long history and older-lines paging on `phone` (1,265 lines): opens at the tail in 1.1 s; "Show 200 earlier lines" pages back and holds the row under it; a second page reaches the 16:xx turns; recorded (`media/mobile/cycle-37/recording-long-history-paging-20s.mp4`). M-120 (a scroll lock after paging) withdrawn — the harness swiped on the composer's inset.
- Several workers at once on `pod`: four workers, four Done lines, Agents 3 → 7, all seven in the sheet, kept across a reopen.
- Cold start 3.1 s (was 6 s). Background 8 s → chat as it was. Attachments: photo chip with a line.
- **M-121 fixed** (#365): the direct kernel and the roster's `phone` are one kernel; the list drew it twice. `hello.store` folds the pod row into its roster twin.
- **M-122 fixed** (#365): Settings' token edit put up iOS's "Save Password?" sheet every time; the fields are `.oneTimeCode` now. Token editing exercised for the first time: wrong token → rows Off, right token → rows back.
- Style: composer at rest and photo chip vs Cursor (`01-`), list after M-121 vs All Agents (`08-`), one-surface check vs desktop #359 (M-123: already so on the phone).
- M-119: `arboslife/demo` still served by an old image (hello without `git_sha`); the #357 rerun waits. M-124: second store loss of the mobile documents at 00:44, restored from the Mac mirror; guarded mirror script since.
- Mac cost ≈ $31 (35 h at $0.88/h).
- Next: the `demo` rerun when its hello carries a `git_sha`; otherwise the worker-chat pair.

## Cycle 38 report (01:30 UTC, 09-17)

Short cycle, started by hand on the coordinator's kick after the timer question.

- Cycle timer: alive the whole time (fired 00:00:16; the cycle-37 report followed at 00:31 and 00:46). Recreated it anyway with a rule that every cycle turn ends with a `## Cycle N report` message and a copy in this file, so a missed message can be found.
- `demo` journey: **not run** — the `demo` kernel is still an old image (M-125): the machine row says `b6e7098`, the kernel's own `hello` says otherwise. Evidence to the mesh worker; the rerun is the first item once `hello` carries a `git_sha`.
- Style pass vs the Mac's one-surface look (#359): consistent, nothing to change (M-126; `media/mobile/cycle-38/01-`).
- Call screen, both states, in the simulator (no microphone → "No microphone input."): `03-`.
- PR: #365 (M-121, M-122) still the cycle's PR; nothing new to fix from this half.
- Mac cost ≈ $32 (36 h at $0.88/h).
- Next: the `demo` rerun on the mesh worker's word; otherwise the worker-chat pair against Cursor's agent chat.

## Cycle 39 report (02:10 UTC, 09-17)

- `demo` came back on `b6e7098` (hello with `git_sha`, raw frames) at 01:3x, so the journey ran first: run 30, `main` 0fede124 (= TestFlight 1194, which carries #365's M-121/M-122). J1 P (seed 125 s), J3 P, J4 P, J6 P (away card in the run), J7 **P on the merits by the runner**, P1–P3 P (photo answered, scoped call answered, connect 0.50 s), J5 F (model), PUSH U with reason.
- **But J2 failed, and it names JB-6**: every spawn on arboslife is refused in 35 ms — `start arbos-kernel serve: No such file or directory` — because the worker daemon starts children from `current_exe()` and its binary is gone from under it (runs 29 and 30). The root did the work itself, so J7's pass is not the worktree test #357 needs; JB-5 stays untested. Note to mesh and kernel: `features-inbox/2026-09-17-mobile-spawn-refused-daemon-binary-gone.md`. The runner now scores a refused spawn F instead of P.
- Phone fix, PR #373 (M-127): a refused spawn is one plain line — who would not start, where, why — instead of a "Starting worker" line with the reason inside a fold; `host` read as well as `machine` so the F15 "Running on <machine>" line fires on mesh records.
- Media: `media/mobile/journey/0917-014026/` (29 files, the whole run), `media/mobile/cycle-39/01-`, `02-`.
- Mac cost ≈ $33 (37 h at $0.88/h).
- Next: the `demo` rerun the moment the mesh worker says the daemon is restarted (the worktree test); otherwise voice notes and barge-in re-measure (cycles 12 and 14, the oldest rows left).

## Cycle 40 report (02:30 UTC, 09-17)

- Answer first: #373 (cycle 39) makes a refused spawn one plain line on the phone — who would not start, where, why — instead of a "Starting worker" line with the reason in a fold; verified on `demo`'s replay; ready for review. The cycle around it: run 30 on `demo` (`b6e7098`), J7 P on the merits but J2 F — every spawn on arboslife refused, ENOENT on `arbos-kernel serve` (JB-6, the daemon's binary gone from under it), so JB-5's worktree path is still untested.
- This cycle, against tonight's kernel work: a #374 kernel built on the Mac with a 20 s stall clock, the app on it through launch args. The stall notice reached the phone 32 s after the send but was cut at two lines with raw backticks, and the phone had no Stop for the line to offer. PR #376: notices read whole with code chips, "Waiting on <worker> — <step>" instead of "Working waiting on", and a stop square in the composer while a turn runs that ends it ("Worked 32s", "Stopped by you").
- F15's root cause recorded (M-131): the macOS kernel deaf to its finished children — Jacob's Mac, not the phone.
- Media: `media/mobile/cycle-40/01-`…`04-`.
- Mac cost ≈ $34 (38 h at $0.88/h).
- Next: the `demo` rerun on the mesh worker's word (JB-6); otherwise voice notes and the barge-in re-measure.

## Cycle 41 report (06:20 UTC, 09-17)

Answer first: the Mac is back, the loop's harness is no longer only on it, and JB-6 can now be made to happen on demand — which is what let the phone be shown naming it.

- **The Mac.** Its only private key lived in `/tmp` on the previous worker's VM, so losing the worker lost the machine (M-132). Recovered from first principles: new key pair `arbos-mobile-2` with its private half **in the vault** (`l6zmhcj7thvr6bi7xdfr36akc4`), the disk imaged before anything was touched, relaunched on the same dedicated host. Everything survived — Xcode 27, the iOS 27 runtime, the `Arbos iPhone 15 Pro` on its old udid, `idb`, `ffmpeg`, `~/arbos`, 54 cycles of `~/mobile-out`, `~/mobile-docs`. **Nothing reinstalled.** New address `13.217.52.163`, instance `i-016b41e8f552dec09`.
- **The harness** (M-133): recovered off the imaged disk and committed as `deploy/mobile/` in #387, scenario one-offs under `deploy/mobile/scenarios/`. The TestFlight poll now runs from this VM out of `deploy/feedback/`, so feedback survives the Mac being down.
- **The journey records its kernel** (#387): `kernel.py hello` reads the kernel's own `--version` line off the attach socket — not the hub's `/list`, whose `git_sha` is whichever process registered last. `mac-journey.sh` reads it at both ends of a run and `journey-record.py` writes the history line, so QA stops printing "kernel commit: not recorded by the phone loop". Verified live: `arbos-kernel 0.2.0 01e6b6530809 protocol 1 BINARY-GONE`.
- **JB-6 on demand** (M-134): a #385 kernel started from a copied binary, the file then deleted under it. It serves happily; `binary_gone` is true in its `hello` and in its `builds` entry. The phone now says so twice — the row reads "Restart needed", the chat says it once as a plain line at the tail. The first build drew neither: the line was yielded on `hello` and the transcript seed replaces the item list, so it was wiped before it was drawn; fixed in #396, verified on the rebuilt app.
- PRs: **#387 merged** (the harness, the journey's kernel commit, the app reading `builds`); **#396** open with the one-line ordering fix, which #387's merge beat to the branch.
- **For the features agent** (M-135): the kernel computes `binary_gone` live for every `hello`, but the hub only hears it in the registration frame — so a binary deleted *after* a kernel registered, which is JB-6 exactly, leaves the roster silent until the link bounces.
- Feedback poll: 19 submissions on the account, all 19 already in the log. Nothing new.
- Media: `media/mobile/cycle-41/01-launch.png`, `02-list-restart-needed.png`, `03-chat-binary-gone.png`, `roster-before.json`, `roster-after.json`.
- Cost: the dedicated host has billed ~$36 since 09-15 and bills whether or not an instance runs, so the episode added under $1 of AWS (two small helpers, some snapshots, all deleted). What it cost was about three hours of loop time, 109 minutes of it the host's scrubbing workflow.
- Next: the oldest rotation rows — voice notes (cycle 14) and the barge-in re-measure (cycle 12) — then the `demo` journey on the new recording, with the kernel commit in the record this time.

## Cycle 42 report (06:50 UTC, 09-17)

Oldest rotation rows: barge-in (last done cycle 12) and the voice path (cycle 14). Recording due and taken.

- **The find: the first 320 ms of every call went in the bin** (M-138). The call opens the microphone and then connects, and connecting takes 0.64–0.77 s; captured frames were only pointed at the socket once `connect()` returned. Fixed in #402 by holding the newest two seconds and flushing them when there is somewhere to send them. Measured before, 42 of the rig's first 50 frames reached the socket; after, 50 of 50.
- **It needed a new rig** (M-140). The loop could not exercise the microphone path at all: `-injectWav` writes straight into the socket and never touches capture. `-micWav` plays a clip into `audio.onCapture` from the moment the engine starts, and counts frames at both ends. Two of my own wrong turns are in the commit history rather than tidied away — I first read `-injectWav`'s clipped transcripts as evidence, and then suspected my own rig's pacing.
- **Barge-in: 500–522 ms** over four runs against 401 ms at cycle 12 (M-136) — but the number is the round trip to the gateway, not the phone. The phone's own part is the 2–4 ms between being told and cutting playback, and has not moved. Quoted separately from now on. Connect has gone 0.28–0.45 s → 0.64–0.77 s over the same period, which points the same way.
- **Kernel-answered first audio 4.4–8.4 s** against 2.93 s when first measured (M-137). All of it inside the kernel's turn; small talk unchanged at 502–682 ms. Not the phone's, but it is what Jacob feels when he asks his project something.
- **For the voice gateway** (M-139): with the phone proven to send every frame (`clip=450 sent=450`), the server still loses "Hello" and splits the sentence, six runs of six. `features-inbox/2026-09-17-mobile-first-word-lost-in-the-speech-server.md`, with a reproduction.
- Purpose check: the call screen is one surface, voice-first — orb, the project's name, nothing else. Consistent with the Mac app.
- **Settled after the first write-up**: the burst was the last candidate for the residual loss, and it is not the cause — `-flushPace` sent the held frames at real time and at four times real time, six runs, same transcript every time, `clip=50 sent=50` throughout. The switch was removed again. And the final A/B, three runs each way, is the cleanest statement of the whole cycle: 40/42/40 of 50 frames before, 50/50/50 after, while the transcripts say nothing useful — the fullest sentence of the six came from a run that lost eight frames (`media/mobile/cycle-42/mic-path-before-after.txt`). The counters are the evidence; the transcript is the illustration.
- **M-141**: the store dropped the cycle-42 rows again between writing and re-reading them; restored from the Mac mirror, third time it has been the only surviving copy.
- PR: **#402**. Feedback poll: 19 submissions, all already in the log, nothing new.
- Media: `media/mobile/cycle-42/01-launch.png`, `02-call-mic-path.png`, `03-call-speaking.png`, `04-call-after-barge-in.png`, `05-call-speaking-from-first-moment.png`, `06-call-reply.png`, `mic-path-before-after.txt`, `recording-call-mic-path-25s.mp4` (the flow this cycle is about: a call whose speech is heard from the first moment), `recording-call-barge-in-28s.mp4`.
- Next: voice notes in the composer (cycle 14, the row this cycle did not reach), then the worker-chat style pair against Cursor's agent chat, and the `demo` journey with the kernel commit now recorded.
